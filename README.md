# Logger

A module to handle winston loggers.

## Project dependencies

One important point to be mentioned is that as you scale you architecture to micro services it's very important to sign your request with an unique identifier. So every requested service will contain the ID making it trackable.

To do that you **MUST PROPERLY** install this **REQUIRED** module:

**express-x-request-id**

https://github.com/SunsetRiders/express-x-request-id

## Logger types

This implementation provides 4 loggers types and 1 request middleware.

**1. debug:** Use to log any type of data mostly used for checking the application/process cycle;

**2. error:** Use to log error objects/messages;

**3. info:** Use to log any type of data that is a regular information.

**4. warn:** Use to log any type of data that is a warning.

**5. request:** A middleware that logs every incoming request



### Middleware to bind logger to req object

```javascript
const ExpressXRequestId = require('express-x-request-id');
const Logger            = require('logger');

...
// DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE EXPRESS-X-REQUEST-ID
// MODULE BEFORE THE LOGGER REQUEST
// Set middleware express X-Request-Id
app.use(ExpressXRequestId.middleware);

// Bind logger to req object
this.app.use(Logger.middleware);
...
```

### Using Request middleware

Since it's a middleware should be added into your **app.js** file.

```javascript
const ExpressXRequestId = require('express-x-request-id');
const Logger            = require('logger');

...
// DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE EXPRESS-X-REQUEST-ID
// MODULE BEFORE THE LOGGER REQUEST
// Set middleware express X-Request-Id
app.use(ExpressXRequestId.middleware);

// Request logger
// Since it's a middleware that don't require the req and res objects
app.use(Logger.requestMiddleware({/*Config object*/}));
...
```

## Transport ways

The transport is basically ways to show/save the logs.

There're 3 available transport ways:

**1. console** 

Displays the log direct in the terminal.

**2. file**

Puts the log inside a file.

**3. logentries**

Send the log to log entries web service.

## Usage

Since the middleware binds logger to req object it can be accessed with:

```javascript
req.logger(type, data, config); // This will automatically insert/show the log
```
**1. type**

Use one of the 4 logger type. (String)

**2. data**

The data you want to store in log. (Object or String)

**2. config**

Configuration object (Object)

**IMPORTANT: If you want to log any type you must always use it from the req object described above** 

## Configurations

You can pass configuration to the logger at the moment of instantiation.

```javascript
const Logger = require('logger');
const LoggerDebug = new LoggerDebug(req, res, {/*options object goes here*/}).execute();
```

| Option Â  | Description  |   Value   | Default |
| ---------|--------------|-----------|---------|
| color | Display color when transport way is console | boolean | false |

## Usage

It's pretty easy
